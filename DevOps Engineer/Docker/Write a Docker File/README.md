####  Write a Docker File 

As per recent requirements shared by Nautilus application development team they need some custom images to be created for one of their project. Some initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. So create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 2 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with below mentioned requirements:

a. Use ubuntu as the base image.

b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6300 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc)
