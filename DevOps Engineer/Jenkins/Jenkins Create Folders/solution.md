#### Jenkins Create Folders

1. Open a Jenkins dashboard on port 8081 and login with the username `theadmin` and password `Adm!n321`, respectively.

2. We can see both the jobs, `httpd-php` and `services` are alredy been created.

3. Create a new item, name it as `Apache` as mentioned in the problem statement. Choose a type as folder.

4. Now, go to each job and move it to Apache directory as shown below,
